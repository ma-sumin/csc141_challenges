#5-3. Alien Colors #1

#The version of the program that passes the if test
#Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green'
alien_color = 'green'
#Write an if statement to test whether the alieon's color is green
if (alien_color == 'green'):
#If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points
    print("\nCongratulations! You just earned 5 points.")


#Another version of the program that fails the if test
alien_color = 'green'
#Write an if statement to test whether the alieon's color is yellow
if (alien_color == 'yellow'):
#If it is not, there will have no output
    print("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.")
