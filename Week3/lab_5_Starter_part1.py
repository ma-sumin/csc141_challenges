The Albright Lions sold candy bars last month!
Your job is to calculate the total amount of weight that was produced
in ounces and pounds last month.


1. You will ensure that you have left 3 comments at the top of your file
    # Your Name
    # Date
    # brief description of what this file does

2. For this program, you must prompt the user to enter the weight of one
    Lion Bar, in ounces. The user should have the ability to enter a non-whole number.
    Then you must prompt the user again to enter how many Lion Bars were made last month.
    The user should only be able to enter a whole number as a half of a Lion Bar would not
    count as a one full Lion Bar created

3. Once you have collected your data, you will work to match the sample output for this lab.
    When printing the weight in pounds, it must be a whole number, therefore your output
    should not include a non-zero value after the decimal. Since we are looking for the nearest
    whole number in pounds, you need to also print the left over weight in ounces
    (If I have 16.5 ounces, that should be displayed as -> 1.0 lb(s), 5 oz)

    HINT* - The modulus operator might help get the correct output

4. After completing above 3 steps, remove all comments in this file that are
    not your own and do not forget to rename this file to lionBars.py
