2. For this program, you must prompt the user to enter how many scores they
    would like to average. This value should be a whole number. Using a "for" loop,
    you'll then want to ask the user to enter a score for each score they want
    to average and add that score to a list

3. Finally, you will calculate the average score of your list and print the result

    not your own and do not forget to rename this file to avgScore.py
